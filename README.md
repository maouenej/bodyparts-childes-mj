- 👋 Hi, I’m @maouenej
- 👀 I’m interested in cognitive development: my domain of investigation is language and meaning.
 I come from a perspective that looks at how experiences of having body parts as babies (Piaget, Thelen & Smith)
connects with early-learned verbs, categorization, syntax, adult associations. I have been working on body parts and early-learned verbs
in children, and adults, in English and crosslinguistically (Hebrew, Japanese, Hindi, Telugu).
I have used free associations, repeated associations, fMRI, CHILDES and MCDI corpora,lexico-semantic networks of nouns
in children with DLD and children with TLD, early features networks development, associative networks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mathematica. I'm planing to learn Python and RNN during my sabbatical.
